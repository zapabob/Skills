# SpecStory Project Stats

Fetches project statistics from SpecStory's cloud platform, showing contributor counts, session activity, and other project metrics.

## How It Works

1. **Identifies** the project via `.specstory/.project.json`, git remote, or folder name
2. **Calls** the SpecStory Cloud API
3. **Returns** project statistics in JSON format
4. **Presents** the data in a readable summary

## Prerequisites

- Project must be synced to SpecStory Cloud
- Node.js must be available to run the script

## Usage

### Slash Command

| User says | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| `/specstory-project-stats` | Fetch stats for current project |
| `/specstory-project-stats` | Same as above (no arguments needed) |

### Direct Script Usage

```bash
# Fetch stats for current project
node skills/specstory-project-stats/scripts/get-stats.js

# With custom API endpoint (for development)
SPECSTORY_API_URL=http://localhost:5173 node skills/specstory-project-stats/scripts/get-stats.js
```

## Output

The script outputs JSON with project statistics:

```json
{
  "project_id": "specstoryai/agent-skills",
  "sessions": {
    "total": 156,
    "last_30_days": 47,
    "last_7_days": 12
  },
  "contributors": {
    "total": 5,
    "active_last_30_days": 3
  },
  "activity": {
    "first_session": "2025-10-15",
    "last_session": "2026-01-28",
    "avg_sessions_per_week": 8.2
  }
}
```

## Project ID Resolution

The script determines project ID in this order:

1. **`.specstory/.project.json`** - Uses `git_id` or `workspace_id` field
2. **Git remote** - Extracts repo name from `origin` remote URL
3. **Folder name** - Falls back to current directory name

## Error Handling

| Error | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| 404 | Project not found | Project needs to sync to SpecStory Cloud first |
| 401 | Unauthorized | API endpoint may require authentication |
| Network error | Can't reach API | Check internet connection |

## Present Results to User

After fetching stats, present them in a friendly format:

### Example Response (success)

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `SPECSTORY_API_URL` | `https://cloud.specstory.com` | API endpoint |

## Notes

- Statistics are fetched from SpecStory Cloud, not local history
- Project must have synced sessions to show meaningful stats
- The API is public and doesn't require authentication for basic stats
